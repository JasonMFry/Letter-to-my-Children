How to achieve success in life

## Project Intro
This is a pretty big subject. I consider myself a theoretical expert, but only experientially proficient (which is to say I take my own advice ~70% of the time because I'm not as diligent or disciplined as I need to be). However, my expertise is very narrowly-focused and hyper-opinionated. I'm going to narrowly define 'success', as well as 'achieve', and then lay out how I think my children (or anyone else who accepts my definitions and premises) should go about achieving success. 

## How to Contribute
This project will consist of various chapters and will take quite some time to complete, and I welcome input. If you want to dialogue and provide input, look through the [issues](https://github.com/JasonMFry/Letter-to-my-Children/issues) and comment on them, or [create a new issue](https://github.com/JasonMFry/Letter-to-my-Children/issues/new).
