How to achieve success in life

## Project Intro
This is a pretty big subject. I consider myself a theoretical expert, but only experientially proficient (which is to say I take my own advice ~70% of the time because I'm not as diligent or disciplined as I need to be). However, my expertise is very narrowly-focused and hyper-opinionated. I'm going to narrowly define 'success', as well as 'achieve', and then lay out how I think my children should go about achieving success. 

I really enjoy the Wisdom Literature of the Bible--Jobs, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes. This project is heavily inspired by Proverbs, which is primarily a letter written from a father to a son about how to be successful in life. This project is my wisdom, passed down to my children, so that they may be successful.
